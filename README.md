# SAYURI
Discord.py Bot

Sayuri is the first personal project I took up after I started coding. Sayuri is coded in python using the discord.py API for building discord bots.

Includes all the funky stuff that you expect a discord bot to do: 
<ul>
<li>Moderation - ban, kick, warn, etc.</li>
<li>Server logs - username change, nickname change, message delete, etc.</li>
<li>Experience calculation and leaderboard based on user chat frequency.</li>
<li>Command info and Help</li>
<li>New user greeting</li>
<li>Conduct giveaways</li>
<li>Starboard system to pin "important" messages</li>
<li>My personal additions: <ul>
  <li>Set reminder</li>
  <li>Return datetime of specified location</li>
  <li>Basic arithmetic operations</li>
</ul></li></ul>

And many more commands...
